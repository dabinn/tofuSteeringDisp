DofuSteeringDisp
=============
This a an Assetto Corsa APP for streering inpout display.
The original APP is hard to distinguish the wheel turning direction/wheel position, especially when drifting. So it had to limits the steer angle at the display.
I added gradient color indicator on steer wheel, now it's very clear even which 900 degree setting.

This is a modification of these apps
