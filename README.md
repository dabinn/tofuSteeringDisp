=============
This a an Assetto Corsa APP for streering inpout display.

I have been using the original APP for years, the main issue is that it's hard to distinguish the wheel turning direction/wheel position, especially when drifting. So it had to limits the steer angle at the display.

I added gradient color indicator on steer wheel icon, and removed the rotation degree limit. Now the wheel position is very clear even which 900/1080 degree setting.
